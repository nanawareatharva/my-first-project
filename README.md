# About my first project on GitHub

# 📚 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Project

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** project repository! This project showcases core concepts and implementations of commonly used data structures and algorithms using the **C programming language**, based on both academic curriculum and hands-on practice problems.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project includes theoretical insights, code implementations, and complexity analysis of:

- 📌 **Arrays** – Basic operations like traversing, insertion, deletion, sorting & searching.
- 🥞 **Stacks** – Array-based & linked list implementations with operations like push, pop, peek.
- 📬 **Queues** – Linear and circular queues, including queue operations and use-cases.
- 🔗 **Linked Lists** – Singly linked lists with insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.
- 🌳 **Trees** – Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL Trees, and tree traversals.
- 🌐 **Graphs** – Directed & undirected graphs, adjacency matrix/list, and graph traversal.
- 📊 **Time Complexity** – Analyzing performance using Big-O Notation.
- 🧮 **Algorithms** – Includes recursion, infix-to-postfix conversion, and searching techniques.
